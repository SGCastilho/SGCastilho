**`Game Developer`**

My interest in game development started in 2012, when I got my first computer. Back then, I would spend hours researching how to create games, and it was during this process that I discovered how much I truly loved doing it.

Currently, I work with Unity, using C#. I am in the process of learning other engines like Unreal Engine and Godot.
